# Legacy Code
These are copies of the code that were written before
@jboetticher took over the project. They will stay for reference,
but should not be compiled.  
Some comments were not written by the author, so they may not 
reflect the original intention.  

## Breakdown
I believe that the MainSmartContract assumes that the other contracts
are imported in the environment. I am unsure what SmartContractCode
does, but SmartContractCodeExplicit is a copy with additional 
functions, which makes me believe that it is the most updated version 
of the contract logic.
